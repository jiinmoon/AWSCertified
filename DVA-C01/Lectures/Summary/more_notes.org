* AWS SAM
** Deploying with AWS SAM

AWS SAM uses AWS CloudFormation as the underlying deployment
mechanism. You can deploy your application by using AWS SAM CLI.

You can use =sam pacakge= and =sam deploy= cammands. Note that these
are identical to their AWS CLI commands for =aws cloudformation
package= and =aws cloudformation deply=, respectively.
