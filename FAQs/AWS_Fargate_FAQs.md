# AWS Fargate FAQs

## General

**What is AWS Fargate?**

AWS Fargate is _a serverless compute engine for containers_ that works with
both AMazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes
Service (EKS).

It supports all common container use cases.

**How should I choose when to use AWS Fargate?**

Choose AWS Fargate to launch their containers without having to provision or
manage EC2 instances.

If you require greater control of EC2 instances, then use ECS or EKS without
Fargate.
